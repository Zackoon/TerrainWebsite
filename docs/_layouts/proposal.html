    <h1>Summary and Team Members</h1>
    We plan on creating an infinite terrain effect. There will be mountains, water, grass, and snow, users will be able
    to move around the infinite landscape.

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        <strong>Built by Ian Dong, Zack Oon, Colin Steidtmann, and Satvik Muddana.</strong>

    <h1>Problem Description</h1>

    <ul>
        <h3>
            Problem
        </h3>
        <li>
            Create a visually appealing and realistic infinite terrain effect with varying landscapes (mountains, water,
            grass,
            snow) that users can navigate.
        </li>
        <h3>
            Importance
        </h3>
        <li>
            This is important for creating immersive virtual environments in games or simulations.
        </li>
        <h3>
            Challenge
        </h3>
        <li>

            The challenge lies in generating a seamless and diverse terrain that can be explored without visible
            repetition
            while also ensuring smooth movement transitions between different terrain types.
        </li>
        <h3>
            Proposed Solution
        </h3>
        <li>
            Use procedural generation techniques to create the terrain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Choose vegetation/surface material (texture) based on the elevation of the terrain (high elevation = snow,
            low
            elevation = water).
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a streaming approach to load terrain data efficiently, prioritizing chunks that are closer to the user's
            current
            position.
        </li>
        <li>
            Implement a control system for the user to navigate the terrain
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>
        Goals and Deliverables
    </h1>

    <ul>
        <h3>
            What We Plan to Deliver
        </h3>
        <li>
            We must create an infinite terrain of mountains and valleys with the vegetation/texture defined by the
            virtual environment elevation.
        </li>
        <li>
            We must deliver a video demo that shows a fly-over of the terrain.
        </li>
        <li>
            It may not look realistic, but it must be recognizable as mountains/snow/water/grass
        </li>
        <h3>
            What We Hope to Deliver
        </h3>
        <li>
            Aspirations:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEae1uH4HC4&ab_channel=HadrienMilano ">Infinite Terrain
                        with Fractal Brownian Motion </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            We hope to make it look super realistic.
        </li>
        <li>
            We hope to use some shading techniques to make it look more realistic.
        </li>
        <li>
            We hope to add realistic clouds, perhaps clouds that the user moves through (adding rain would be a bonus).
        </li>
        <h3>
            Measuring our Performance
        </h3>
        <li>
            Speed of loading new terrain chunks. We hope for it to be constant throughout, not slow down for any reason
            no matter how much the user moves through the virtual world. We hope for it to be fast.
        </li>
        <li>
            Measure how long we keep the simulation running (i.e. we would prune areas or somehow make far away places
            that have already been visited take up less space?)
        </li>
    </ul>
